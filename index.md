## Project 1

![It's Fine Alt Text](Previews/Project1Preview.PNG)

  My first project in GES 486 was the creation of an elevation map for Baltimore. I had wished to create a flood vulnerability index through this but ultimately I couldn't make that happen. However, I consider this elevation map one of the most aesthetically pleasing maps I have ever created. 

  I made this map starting out from a DEM of Maryland that I clipped to Baltimore. I used the Re-classify tool to reform the elevation values in terms of census blocks, and properties in the city. I utilized different transparency values and color ramps in order to allow the TIFFs to seamlessly lay on top of each other.

  This project allowed me to portray a map of Baltimore's elevation in a way I'd never tried before. The gradients going on allow for easy understanding of the relative elevations in the city, with the lowest areas to the south and east, and the highest areas to the north and west.

## Project 2

  My second project in GES 486 was a group of Black population maps for the state of maryland in 3 different years. The years I chose were 2000, 2010, and 2017. I utilized various counts of census data and estimates in order to get the data for this. A lot of time was spent in excel combing through data, cutting out information that was non-hispanic or hispanic estimates (as I wanted both), cutting away fields that were of the wrong locations, as well as making calculations of percentages or totals due to lapses in local totals in certain counties some years (2000 data especially required this.)

  I found that Maryland's Black population resides most heavily in Prince George's County and Baltimore City. In total numbers, black folks are mostly in central Maryland with much lower populations the further away you get from DC & Baltimore. In percentages, there is a pocket of black folks in Southeast Maryland, due to the presence of the HBCU UMES in Somerset County. Charles County has seen a growth in black population percentage partly due to the gentrification in DC displacing black and impoverished residents. It's effectively been growing as a cheaper alternative to Prince George's County due to it's relative closeness to DC and the Washington Metropolitan Area. 

  Montgomery, Howard, Baltimore, Anne Arundel Counties have hosted a modest and increasing Black Population. These areas largely suburban and middle class populations reflect sects of upward mobility and recent history of 'black flight'. However, Prince Georges' County hosts some of the largest and richest black communities in country, while also harboring great inequity and segregation among black communities. This has only increased over the past few decades.

  I hit quite a few roadblocks on this thing along the way but I am ultimately happy with the way this turned out. A lot of the symbology came together the day I finally submitted it, as it was bugging or refusing to appear for a long time. I was able to express the legend in a pretty solid way as well.

## Project 3

  My third project on display here was the second GES 486 lab which had use clip an elevation tiff to a raster of the state of Maryland, and then convert it to a vector format with 5 different elevation category. We were given the freedom to classify the elevation classes how we wished, and I decided to classify it in a way that expressed the complexity and variation of the mountainous regions in the western, and northern, parts of Maryland.

  The main drawback in expressing the elevation this way is that it sacrificed the differences in the low elevation and sea-level regions from the piedmont to the atlantic coastal plains of eastern Maryland. Had the goals of the project encouraged us to use more than 5 elevation classes, I likely would have expressed the differences between those regions instead of making much of the eastern and central parts of the state appear uniform in elevation heights.

# Project 4

  My fourth project on display was the first GES 486 lab of the semester which simply had us make a map of Baltimore in terms of pre-determined land use classes. I took the chance to be very artistically inclined with this map and used combinations of various color gradients to make each land use classification appear distinctly coloured. I was trying to balance a few things here, where I wanted many of the classes to pop out brightly and confidently, but not so much that it was gaudy or painful to stare at for too long, as well as allowing the different classes to still be useful for understanding the information that the map tries to convey.

# Final Project

## Write-up
For my final project I would like to make a precipitation intensity map for Maryland. 2018 marks the rainiest year in the history of the state so with the time I have left I would like to create a map that illustrates this or recent year's rain totals. I figure that I would end up with a map simular to the Alaskan heat maps we created for the 2nd lab this year. I would need to acquire some kind of data that includes rain / precipitation totals in the state and then work on how to interpolate that to some sort of shape or point values. Maybe the data would be based by local locations that regularly could rain totals. I'd like to use this year's rain totals if possible but I'm unsure if that data would be available before the year ends. If I were provided or able to find the required data to accomplish this project I definitely could create something like this in QGIS. It'd also be cool if I were able to incorporate information on thunder and lightning frequency as well.
